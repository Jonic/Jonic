# 👋 Hiya! I’m Jonic.

I’m a Software Engineer. I used to work for [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). I’m named after Sonic the Hedgehog. I made [a video game](https://jonic.itch.io/knifey-spoony) one time. I like to make things with [code](https://www.100yen.co.uk/code). I’m really good at [Tetris](https://www.100yen.co.uk/code/tetris). <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>日本語</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>にほんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>を　<ruby><rb>勉強</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>べんきょう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>しています。</span> I have ADHD. I sing, and play guitar, drums, and piano. I sometimes make things out of electronics. I’m from the UK.
